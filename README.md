# Times-Through-The-Order-Penalty
Assessment of the origins of the "Times Through The Order Penalty", which refers to the empirical observation that batters perform significantly better against a particular pitcher after facing that pitcher for a third time in a single game. Data was scraped from the Baseball-Reference play index (analyzed all plays in the five season period from 2012 to 2016) and then analyzed to see if observations can be explained by pitcher fatigue, batter familiarity with pitcher repertoire, or some combination.  Repository also includes scripts used to scrape and organize data into tidy csv files.
